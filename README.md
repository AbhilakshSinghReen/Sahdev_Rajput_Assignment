# Drawing Rectangles on the Image Uploaded

I have created a client-side website with two pages: Upload and Results. The Upload page should allow users to select an image and click a "Go" button. Upon clicking, the image dimensions are sent to a function in the ApiClient class (refer to the provided link). This function returns an array of rectangles, where each rectangle is defined by its xMin, yMin, xMax, and yMax properties.

It involves drawing these rectangles on the original image and displaying the modified image on the Results page. I have used Javascript library i.e, ReactJS to complete the assignment. 

It is conceivable that rectangles may not be immediately visible upon the initial loading of the website, as they could potentially extend beyond the boundaries of the images. Given the random nature of these rectangles, upon refreshing the website, visibility may occur if the rectangles happen to fall within the bounds of the image.
